# Learning Log

## Day 0

I've been attempting AoC every year since 2017 (plus I went back to do some of 2016), but I've never finished a single
year. This year, I'm coming in with the expectation that I will only do the first 12 days, and anything else is bonus.

## Day 1

Was traveling on day 1, so I did this puzzle on day 2, after solving day 2. Although I didn't really use much regex in
day 2 (at least in the first iteration), I was able to apply what I learned to this one, so I was really happy that
I chose to do the two puzzles in this order. I already knew from some of the reddit posts that part 2 would be much
more difficult than part 1. I did solve part 1 pretty quickly, but part 2 didn't seem that difficult to me, once I found
a library I could import for all the number words to match with. That said, my part 2 solution isn't quite working, and
I'm still not clear why...

## Day 2

After reading the instructions for today, I decided that I would take this chance to learn regex finally. I spent quite
a bit of time struggling with regex. Got something semi-working, but not quite. Frustrated, I decided that it's best for
me to just solve this the way I already know how, and then refactor later to make the solution more elegant.
