# Learning Log

## Day 0

I've been attempting AoC every year since 2017 (plus I went back to do some of 2016), but I've never finished a single
year. This year, I'm coming in with the expectation that I will only do the first 12 days, and anything else is bonus.

## Day 1

Was traveling on day 1, so I did this puzzle on day 2, after solving day 2. Although I didn't really use much regex in
day 2 (at least in the first iteration), I was able to apply what I learned to this one, so I was really happy that
I chose to do the two puzzles in this order. I already knew from some of the reddit posts that part 2 would be much
more difficult than part 1. I did solve part 1 pretty quickly, but part 2 didn't seem that difficult to me, once I found
a library I could import for all the number words to match with. That said, my part 2 solution isn't quite working, and
I'm still not clear why...

[Later]
Okay, as it turns out, I didn't read closely enough, yet again. I had an idea of what the problem was asking for,
and as a result, I struggled for awhile on something that wouldn't have worked anyway. Once it was pointed out to me
what I had not thought about, the solution came easily.

## Day 2

After reading the instructions for today, I decided that I would take this chance to learn regex finally. I spent quite
a bit of time struggling with regex. Got something semi-working, but not quite. Frustrated, I decided that it's best for
me to just solve this the way I already know how, and then refactor later to make the solution more elegant.

## Day 3

Sadly, I only completed part 1 within the first 24 hours of the puzzle release. I didn't start the puzzle until late
and I didn't anticipate how long it would take me to solve. Most of that time was spent trying to figure out all the
off by 1 errors. I figured out most of them relatively quickly, but there was one that took forever for me to find.
I knew that the regex span() function acts similarly to range(), meaning it starts at 0, but I didn't realize that the
ending number was beyond the last position. Ofc, range() works exactly like that too, but somehow I forgot? Heh.

## Day 4

Today's puzzle was the easiest for me thus far. Finished both parts in a little over half an hour. Most of my time was
spent figuring out how to math in python, and then understanding what part 2 was even asking for took a little while.
That said, I was able to complete part 2 on my first try! Didn't expect that at all, especially considering how bad
I was with the off by 1 errors yesterday.

## Day 5


## Day 6



## Day 7



## Day 8

[started on day 9]
Part 1 was easy enough, except for the part where I accidentally put the while loop inside the for loop instead of
the other way around. My part 2 solution works for the example input, but ofc will not finish any time soon unless
I find a different solution. Will come back to this later...

## Day 9

After skipping a couple of days due to some personal issues keeping me busy, I'm happy to see that today's puzzle was
quite easy. That said, I did mess up the subtraction piece in part 2 and spent a bit of time debugging. Anyway, this
means I have the time and energy to go back and work on the days I missed.
