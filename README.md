# Learning Log

## Day 0

I've been attempting AoC every year since 2017 (plus I went back to do some of 2016), but I've never finished a single
year. This year, I'm coming in with the expectation that I will only do the first 12 days, and anything else is bonus.

## Day 1



## Day 2

After reading the instructions for today, I decided that I would take this chance to learn regex finally. I spent quite
a bit of time struggling with regex. Got something semi-working, but not quite. Frustrated, I decided that it's best for
me to just solve this the way I already know how, and then refactor later to make the solution more elegant.
